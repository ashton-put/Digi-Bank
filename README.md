## CS 2300-A Module 3 Open-Ended Project

### Necessary Installations:
* Visit this website and create an account: https://alputnam.w3.uvm.edu/cs2300/M3OEP-alputnam/digibank.php

### Summary of Program
This version of my banking program utilizes a similar structure to the testing website guided project and other in-class website activities such as the Hamilton activity. The C++ code from M2OEP is utilized as a rough outline for the PHP code which handles the transactions in addition to updating the database tables. New users must make an account to perform transactions. These transactions being deposit funds into their account, withdraw funds from their account, and transfer (wire) funds to another account. The webpage also has a PHP login/sign up feature which allows new users to create an account which will be added to the database, or login to an account they have previously created. Once logged in, each page remembers the user who logged in and transactions on their account can be performed. 

### Languages Used
* HTML
* PHP
* CSS
* MySQL

### Which language the program starts in
The program starts in a mix of HTML, PHP, and CSS with the digibank home page. Then begins using MySQL as needed to login to an account, sign up, and perform each transaction one within the protected home page. 

### How I use each language
I use HTML and CSS to give the page a good layout and design. I use PHP to handle backed logic and actions once performed by my C++ code in the M2OEP. MySQL is used to fetch data for users from a database table or write data to specific database tables.

### How the languages are connected
HTML and CSS are interconnected as expected to provide structure and style ot the webpages. PHP handles connecting multiple files together, performing transaction logic, and calls MySQL code to perform operations on the database tables as needed. 

### Other
* No known bugs
* Future work: make sure all input is completely validated (pretty sure its all good), update the CSS, update DB tables to record more data
* Citations for any code that is not mine or instructors: majority of code based upon Intro to Web Dev and Database Design for the Web.
* Grade I think I earned: B
