    <p>What is DIGI-BANK? Well, this is a website made my a college student at UVM who had to make an advanced programming project utilizing at least 2 different programming languages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This led the student to try expanding upon the website projects he saw in the classroom but that proved to be a challenge. He had essentially this entire site programmed in C++ and used the CLI to perform the transactions you can do through this website. Alas, a question (and answers) arose: why use C++ when PHP and MySQL can accomplish the same task, save everything to a database, and both work flawlessly on the web? Plus this student has taken Intro to Web Dev and Database Design for the Web so all of this played into his strengths!</p>
    <br>
    <p>So he decided to construct his M3OEP with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. HTML and CSS are not really 'programming languages' like Python, C++, or Java but PHP and MySQL are considered by the student to be programming languages. Sure, PHP is definitely a programming language and MySQL, HTML, and CSS could count as .33 of a programming language, respectively. Since all 4 are being used on this page that means 1 + .33 + .33 +.33 = 2 (1.99) whole programming languages!</p>
